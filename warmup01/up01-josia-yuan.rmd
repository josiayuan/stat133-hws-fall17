> _**ax^2+bx+c=0**_\
where x represents an unknown, and a, b, and c represent known numbers such that a is not equal to 0."

####Quadratic Equation
> In elementary algebra, the **quadratic formula** is the solution of the quadratic equation.\
> _**x1 = (-b + sqrt(b^2 - 4ac))/2a**_\
> _**x2 = (-b - sqrt(b^2 - 4ac))/2a**_
